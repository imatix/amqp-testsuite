This is a snapshot of the old testsuite made for AMQP/0.6.  
What's interesting here is the language (PAL) that we developed
specifically for this purpose.  The PAL compiler in OpenAMQ is 
in fact generated from the AMQP XML specs.  These tests do not
run since they use old method names and arguments in many places.
